description: Obtain and configure your API key for the modl plugin.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your modl panel at `yourserver.modl.gg`.
2. Navigate to **Settings**.
3. Locate the **API Key** section.
4. Copy the generated API key to your clipboard.

## Adding the Key to Your Plugin

1. Open the modl plugin configuration file on your server, located at `plugins/modl/config.yml`.
2. Set the `api-key` field to the value you copied from the panel:

```yaml
api-key: "your-api-key-here"
```

3. Save the file and restart your server for the changes to take effect.

## Key Security Best Practices

Your API key grants full access to your server's modl integration. Follow these guidelines to keep it secure:

- **Do not share your API key** with anyone who does not need direct access to your server configuration.
- **Do not commit your API key** to version control or post it in public channels.
- **Rotate your key immediately** if you believe it has been compromised. You can generate a new key from the panel settings page, which will invalidate the old one.
- **Restrict file access** to `config.yml` so that only server administrators can read it.

## Verifying the Connection

After configuring the API key and restarting your server:

1. Run the `/modl` command in-game or from the server console.
2. The plugin should report a successful connection to the modl platform.
3. Check the server logs for confirmation that the plugin has authenticated with the API.

If the connection fails, double-check that:

- The API key is copied correctly with no extra spaces or characters.
- Your server has outbound network access to `api.modl.gg`.
- The key has not been rotated or revoked in the panel.
