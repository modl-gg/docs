## Download the Plugin

1. Log in to your modl panel at `yourserver.modl.gg`.
2. Navigate to **Settings** and locate the plugin download section.
3. Download the latest modl plugin JAR file.

## Platform-Specific Instructions

### Spigot (Paper, Purpur, etc.)

1. Place the downloaded JAR file into your server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Restart your server (a full restart is recommended over a reload).
3. The plugin will generate its configuration files on first startup.

### BungeeCord (Waterfall, etc.)

1. Place the downloaded JAR file into your **proxy** server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Restart your BungeeCord proxy.
3. The plugin will generate its configuration files on first startup.

### Velocity

1. Place the downloaded JAR file into your **Velocity proxy** server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Restart your Velocity proxy.
3. The plugin will generate its configuration files on first startup.

### Folia

Folia is natively supported by modl. The setup process is the same as Spigot:

1. Place the downloaded JAR file into your server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Restart your server.
3. The plugin will generate its configuration files on first startup.

## Verify Installation

After your server has restarted, verify the plugin is loaded correctly:

1. Run the `/modl` command in-game or from the server console.
2. If the plugin is installed correctly, you will see the modl command output with version information.
3. Check the server logs for any errors related to modl during startup.

If the plugin fails to load, ensure you are running Java 18 or higher and that the JAR file is not corrupted. Try re-downloading the plugin if issues persist.
