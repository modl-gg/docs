## Download the Plugin

1. Log in to your modl.gg panel at `<yourserver>.modl.gg`.
2. Visit a download source for modl.gg. We recommend [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/modl).
3. Download the latest modl.gg plugin JAR file.

## Platform-Specific Instructions

### Spigot (Paper, Purpur, etc.)

1. Place the downloaded JAR file into your server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Restart your server (a full restart is required over a reload).
3. The plugin will generate its configuration files on first startup.
4. Input the API key into the config.yml, and make other necessary changes.
5. Restart the server again, and you should be good to go.

### BungeeCord (Waterfall, etc.)

1. Place the downloaded JAR file into your **proxy** server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Restart your BungeeCord proxy.
3. The plugin will generate its configuration files on first startup.
4. Input the API key into the config.yml, and make other necessary changes.
5. Restart the server again, and you should be good to go.

### Velocity

1. Place the downloaded JAR file into your **Velocity proxy** server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Restart your Velocity proxy.
3. The plugin will generate its configuration files on first startup.
4. Input the API key into the config.yml, and make other necessary changes.
5. Restart the server again, and you should be good to go.

### Folia

Folia is natively supported by modl.gg! The setup process is the same as Spigot:

1. Place the downloaded JAR file into your server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Restart your server.
3. The plugin will generate its configuration files on first startup.
4. Input the API key into the config.yml, and make other necessary changes.
5. Restart the server again, and you should be good to go.

## Verify Installation

After your server has restarted, verify the plugin is loaded correctly:

1. Run the `/modl` command in-game or from the server console.
2. If the plugin is installed correctly, you will see the modl command output with version information.
3. Check the server logs for any errors related to modl during startup.

If the plugin fails to load, ensure you are running Java 8 or higher and that the JAR file is not corrupted. Try re-downloading the plugin. If issues persist, please contact support on [Discord](https://modl.gg/discord) or [email](mailto:support@modl.gg).
