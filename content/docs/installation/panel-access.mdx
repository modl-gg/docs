## Accessing the Panel

Your modl.gg panel is available at your server's custom subdomain:

```
https://yourserver.modl.gg
```

Replace `yourserver` with the subdomain you chose during registration.

## Logging In

modl.gg uses a **passwordless authentication** system based on email codes:

1. Navigate to your panel URL.
2. Enter the email address associated with your account.
3. Check your inbox for a one-time login code.
4. Enter the code on the login screen to access the panel.

No passwords are required. A new code is sent each time you log in.

## Inviting Staff Members

Once you have access to the panel, you can invite your moderation team:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section in the panel sidebar.
2. Click **Staff Management**.
3. Click **Invite**.
4. Enter the email address of the staff member you want to invite.
5. Select the role you want to assign to them.
6. The invited staff member will receive an email with instructions to access the panel.

## Assigning Roles and Permissions

modl.gg uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage what each staff member can do:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section in the panel.
2. Click **Roles & Permissions**.
3. Create or edit roles to define specific permissions.
4. Assign roles to staff members based on their responsibilities.
5. Permissions control access to features such as issuing punishments, managing tickets, viewing audit logs, and modifying server settings.

Ensure you follow the principle of least privilege -- only grant staff members the permissions they need to perform their duties.
