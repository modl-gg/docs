import { Card, Cards } from "fumadocs-ui/components/card";

## Prerequisites

Before installing modl.gg, make sure you have the following:

- **Java 8 or higher** installed on your server
- A **Minecraft server** running one of the supported platforms:
  - Spigot (or most Spigot forks such as Paper)
  - BungeeCord (or most BungeeCord forks such as Waterfall)
  - Velocity
- A **modl.gg account** with a registered server

## Setup Steps

Getting modl.gg up and running involves four steps:

1. **Download the latest version** of the Minecraft plugin at https://github.com/modl-gg/minecraft/releases
2. **Install the plugin** on your Minecraft server or proxy. If you are using a Velocity or Bungeecord proxy, you MUST Install
the plugin on this proxy and you CANNOT install it on the backend Spigot/Paper server. Only install on Spigot if you are not
running a proxy. If you are using Velocity you should install [Signed Velocity](https://modrinth.com/plugin/signedvelocity) in order
for chat messages to be cancelled properly.
3. **Run your server** and let the config generate, then stop it once modl fully installs (the first run may take a while).
4. **Register your server** on [modl.gg](https://modl.gg) and complete email verification.
5. **Access the web panel** and navigate to Settings > Server & Billing > Server Config.
6. **Generate an API key** and copy it into the modl Minecraft plugin's config.yml (also update the panel url). Do not share
this API key with anyone as it grants full access to your modl panel!
7. **Run your server** again and you are fully installed! Invite your other staff members and make the panel your own!
