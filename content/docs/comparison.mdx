description: How modl compares to LiteBans, AdvancedBan, and other Minecraft moderation plugins.
---

modl takes a fundamentally different approach to Minecraft moderation. Instead of a standalone plugin that stores data in a local database, modl is a full platform with a web panel, REST API, and plugin that all work together.

## Key Differentiators

### Points-Based Escalation
Instead of manually choosing ban durations, modl uses a points system. Each punishment type contributes to a player's social or gameplay offender level, and future punishments automatically escalate based on history.

### Web-Native
The staff panel is a full web application, not a Minecraft GUI. Staff can manage punishments, review tickets, and configure settings from any browser without logging into the game server.
