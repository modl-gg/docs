description: Pardon a player's active punishments by name.

## `POST` /v1/minecraft/players/pardon

Pardon a player's punishments by their username. You can pardon all active punishments, or target a specific punishment type (bans or mutes). A `MANUAL_PARDON` modification is recorded on each pardoned punishment for audit purposes.

When `punishmentType` is omitted, only currently active punishments are pardoned. When a specific type is provided (e.g., `"ban"` or `"mute"`), both active and expired punishments of that type are pardoned (useful for removing accumulated offense points).

### Authentication
