description: Overview of the modl Developer API including authentication, base URL, and response format.
---

import { Cards, Card } from "fumadocs-ui/components/card";

## Base URL

All API requests are made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.modl.gg/v1/minecraft
```

## Authentication

All requests require the `X-API-Key` header with your server's API key. You can obtain your API key from your server's panel settings.

```
X-API-Key: your-api-key-here
```

## Multi-Tenancy

Requests are automatically scoped to the server associated with your API key. You do not need to specify a server ID or domain in your requests.

## Response Format

All responses are returned as JSON with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Common Error Codes

| Status Code | Description |
|---|---|
| `400` | **Bad Request** -- Your request is malformed or missing required fields. |
| `401` | **Unauthorized** -- Missing or invalid API key. |
| `403` | **Forbidden** -- Insufficient permissions for this action. |
| `404` | **Not Found** -- The requested resource does not exist. |
| `409` | **Conflict** -- The request conflicts with the current state of the resource. |
| `413` | **Payload Too Large** -- The request body exceeds the maximum allowed size. |
| `429` | **Rate Limited** -- You have exceeded the rate limit. Slow down and retry after the indicated time. |
| `500` | **Internal Server Error** -- Something went wrong on our end. Try again later. |

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting. If you receive a `429` response, wait before retrying. Rate limit details are included in the response headers.
