modl is a modern, all-in-one moderation platform built for Minecraft server networks. It replaces the patchwork of outdated plugins with a single, unified system — a web panel, an API, and a Minecraft plugin that all work together.

## Key Features

- **Punishment System** — Points-based escalation with configurable types, durations, and severity levels. Supports bans, mutes, kicks, blacklists, and restrictions.
- **Staff Management** — Role-based access control with granular permissions. Manage your team from the web panel.
- **Tickets & Reports** — Players can create tickets and report others in-game. Staff review and resolve them from the panel.
- **AI Chat Moderation** — Powered by Google Gemini, automatically detect and flag chat violations.
- **Alt Account Detection** — IP-based linked account detection to catch ban evaders.
- **Multi-Server Support** — A single panel manages multiple servers. Each server is isolated with its own data, staff, and configuration.
- **Appeals** — Players can appeal punishments through the public web portal.
- **Audit Logging** — Every staff action is logged for accountability.
- **Developer API** — Full REST API for building integrations and custom tooling.

## Architecture

modl has four components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Minecraft Plugin** | Runs on your server (Spigot, BungeeCord, Velocity, or Folia). Enforces punishments, tracks players, and syncs with the API. |
| **Web Panel** | Staff dashboard for managing punishments, tickets, reports, and server settings. |
| **Public Portal** | Player-facing site for appeals and server information. |
| **Backend API** | Central REST API that powers everything. Hosted at `api.modl.gg`. |
