## Key Features

- **Fully custom** — Use your own domain, upload your own icons, change every message. No trace of modl.gg seen by players.
- **Free & Open Source** — The software is your own: compile, modify, self-host, and fork to your heart's desire

- **Dynamic Punishments** — Calculate punishment durations dynamically whilst embracing staff discretion and case-by-case judgement.
  - Social and gameplay point categories. Configurable point thresholds for low, medium, and habitual offender status in each.
  - Configure durations for punishment types depending on severity (lenient, regular, severe) and offender status. 
  - Show custom ban and mute messages for different punishment types
  - Upload evidence, link related report tickets, add staff notes, modify punishment durations, or pardon (remove points)
  - Easy appeal system w/ID, see all punishment details right in the ticket and make your judgement with one click
  - Full audit trail for all punishments, every action creates an immutable note.
  - Option to set up stat-wiping bans (runs a configured command when ban expires)
  - Issue special restrictions that ban a player until they change their username or skin (can still appeal the restriction).

- **Intelligent Chat Reporting** — All reports open a ticket where players are notified of updates and can further respond
  - Chat reports automatically upload full-context chat log for reference
  - Staff can issue punishments directly from ticket page with a single click, or correspond with the reporter
  - When a punishment is issued, staff can link related reports to close each report and notify the reporters of punishment action taken.
  - Premium feature: AI will automatically analyze chat logs from reports and either automatically make a decision or show a suggested action.
  - * To use AI, you must describe the rule breaking offense(s) you want it to look for and link associated punishment type(s).

- **Smart Alt Blocking** — Instead of IP-Banning, issue independent linked-bans for players suspected of being alternate accounts
  - Uses login-times (even failed ones that end up on a ban screen) to link accounts, even with VPN IPs, whilst keeping sibling accounts mostly unbanned
  - Each linked ban is independently appealable, if there was a mistake in linkage, easily reverse the mistake without changing the original ban.
  - Linked bans automatically expire/pardon/duration-change with the original ban unless otherwise pardoned itself.

- **Data Analytics & Audit Logs** — Track punishment trends, ticket response times, player geolocation data, and much more.
  - See every punishment and ticket each staff member touches, rollback (pardon) punishments from a specific staff member
  - Analyze top performing staff, audit suspicious activity, identify trends in activity

- **Staff Management** — Role-based access control with granular permissions. Link staff in-game accounts with panel accounts to sync permissions.
  - Staff receive (togglable) notifications in-game for all new tickets, reports, punishments, and ticket replies
  - Create/delete/modify roles and assign them tostaff members. Staff members with administrative permissions cannot affect others w/higher or same role.
  - No need to use Spigot/Bukkit permission nodes at all. 

- **Efficient Ticketing System** — Use configurable quick-responses, forms, email & in-game notifications, and more to streamline ticketing.
  - Configure quick-responses linked to actions (ex: close ticket, punish reported player, pardon/change-duration-of appealed punishment)
  - Configure forms for players to fill out when submitting appeals (per punishment type), support tickets, bugreports, or staff applications
  - Send email and in-game notifications (held for offline players until they login) notifying of ticket reply w/link to ticket
  - Private staff conversation tab for staff to discuss tickets without players seeing.

- **Homepage & Knowledgebase** — Configure homepage cards with links and knowledgebase articles
  - Put your server's rules, guides, terms of service, and any other document under your own domain.

- **Developer API** — Full REST API for building integrations and custom tooling.
